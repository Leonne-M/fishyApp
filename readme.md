# GET FISHY
This is a simple web application that is inspired by the beauty of exotic fish species.

## More
So the web app is a simple single page  application that displays dat received from an open source API:https://rapidapi.com/myapos--FqlEzvrlv/api/fish-species

Using the following API I was effectively able to get data on the different variety of fish.

FEATURES
The application has a search bar at the top right which helps in quick and easy finds of fishes.
It also posseses a button which redirects the user into wikipedia which allows them to get even more info on the fish species needed.
I hope that with this app will be able to educate more and more pwople on our wonderful underwater ecosystem.
